# Connect_Four_AI
A connect four AI using more advanced adversarial search than the Avalam AI. I created it after I finished the Avalam AI, in order to improve my skills and try more complex approaches

For this one I also wrote the game environnement myself, taking inspiration from the Avalam game environment given by Polytechnique Montr√©al.
It uses more advanced approaches (transposition tables to store all the previously seen moves, code optimization, null window search) which allowed to search more possible actions.
