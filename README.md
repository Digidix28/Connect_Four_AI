# Connect_Four_AI
A connect four AI using more advanced adversarial search than the Avalam AI. I created it after I finished the Avalam AI, in order to improve my skills and try more complex approaches

I wrote the game environnement myself, taking inspiration from the Avalam game environment given by Polytechnique Montréal.
It uses more advanced approaches (transposition tables to store all the previously seen moves, code optimization, null window search) which allowed to search more possible actions.
